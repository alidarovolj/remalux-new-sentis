Troubleshooting and Resolving Issues in the "Remalux New Sentis" Unity Project1. Introduction: Addressing the "Remalux New Sentis" Project ChallengesThis report addresses the operational challenges encountered in the "remalux-new-sentis" Unity project, specifically the manifestation of a black screen upon execution, the presence of errors and warnings within the console logs, and the critical failure to visualize the intended wall segmentation output from the Unity Sentis neural network inference engine. These symptoms—a non-rendering display, logged exceptions, and absent functional output—often point to interconnected issues, particularly in projects that integrate sophisticated external libraries like Unity Sentis for machine learning tasks.The project's designation, "remalux-new-sentis," suggests it might be a recent endeavor to incorporate Sentis or potentially an update or refactoring of a pre-existing system to leverage newer Sentis capabilities. Such scenarios frequently involve navigating the initial setup complexities of the library or reconciling older code patterns and documentation examples with current API versions. This is particularly relevant given significant API evolutions in the Sentis framework, such as the transition from TensorFloat to generic Tensor<T> types. The combination of a black screen and logged errors strongly indicates potential failures during the initialization phase, which are common in new or recently upgraded software integrations.The objective of this document is to furnish a systematic, expert-level troubleshooting guide. This guide is tailored to diagnose and resolve the identified problems, with the ultimate aim of achieving successful and visible wall segmentation using Unity Sentis within the remalux-new-sentis project. The subsequent sections will deconstruct the issues into manageable phases, prioritizing foundational stability before addressing the specifics of machine learning model integration and output visualization.2. Phase 1: Resolving the Black Screen – The First BarrierA black screen at runtime is a fundamental impediment, preventing any further assessment of application functionality. Its resolution is paramount. This phase explores common causes, from basic Unity configuration errors to more complex interactions with rendering pipelines or specialized hardware features.2.1. Standard Unity Black Screen Diagnostics: Foundational ChecksBefore delving into Sentis-specific or advanced rendering pipeline issues, several foundational Unity configurations must be verified, as these are frequent culprits for a black screen.

Scene Inclusion in Build Settings: A primary reason for a black screen, especially in standalone builds, is the omission of the main operational scene from the build settings. Unity projects can contain multiple scenes, but only those explicitly added to the "Scenes In Build" list (accessible via File > Build Settings) are packaged into the final application. If the scene intended to run is not in this list, the application may load an empty or default scene, resulting in a black screen.1 To verify, open the Build Settings dialog and ensure the correct scene is listed and enabled (checked). If missing, the "Add Open Scenes" button can be used if the scene is currently open in the editor, or the scene asset can be dragged directly into the list.


Main Camera Configuration: The scene requires at least one active and correctly configured Camera to render anything. The designated Main Camera should be enabled in the hierarchy. While not always mandatory, scripts often rely on Camera.main to access the primary camera, which requires the camera GameObject to be tagged "MainCamera". The camera's "Clear Flags" property (e.g., Skybox, Solid Color, Depth only, Don't Clear) determines how the background is treated, and its "Culling Mask" determines which object layers are rendered. If the culling mask inadvertently excludes all visible scene geometry, a black screen or an empty view can result. Furthermore, the camera's position, orientation, and clipping planes (near and far) must be set such that the scene content falls within its view frustum.1


Scene Integrity and Startup Errors: Critical errors occurring in the Awake() or Start() methods of essential GameObjects' scripts can halt script execution prematurely. If such an error occurs before the rendering loop is fully established or before key rendering components are initialized, it can lead to a black screen. The Unity console log is the primary diagnostic tool here; any red error messages appearing immediately upon startup should be investigated and resolved as a priority. These errors might not be directly related to rendering but could prevent rendering-critical scripts from executing.


Graphics API Compatibility: In less common scenarios, the Graphics API selected for the project (e.g., Vulkan, Metal, DirectX11, DirectX12, OpenGLES) might have compatibility issues with the target hardware or platform drivers. This can sometimes manifest as a complete rendering failure. These settings are found in Project Settings > Player > Other Settings (platform-specific tabs). Testing with a different, widely supported Graphics API can help rule this out.

The presence of errors and warnings in the logs, as reported for the remalux-new-sentis project, alongside the black screen, suggests that a startup script error is a plausible cause. If this error originates from the Sentis integration itself—for instance, a failure to load the neural network model or initialize the inference worker—it could certainly disrupt the application's initialization sequence sufficiently to prevent any rendering. Therefore, while these general Unity checks are important, the errors logged by Sentis (to be addressed in Phase 2) might hold the key to resolving the black screen.2.2. Investigating Universal Render Pipeline (URP) Conflicts (Conditional: If URP is in use)If the remalux-new-sentis project utilizes the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), several URP-specific configurations can lead to a black screen if misconfigured.

URP Asset Configuration: URP requires a URP Asset to be assigned in Project Settings > Graphics. This asset, along with its associated Renderer Data (e.g., Forward Renderer, 2D Renderer), dictates how URP renders scenes. If no URP Asset is assigned, or if the assigned asset or its renderer data is missing or corrupted, URP may fail to render, resulting in a black screen.


Renderer Features and Custom Passes: URP's extensibility through ScriptableRendererFeatures allows for injecting custom render passes. If the project employs such features, perhaps for post-processing effects or custom visualization of the segmentation mask, errors within these custom C# scripts or their associated shaders can break the rendering chain.2 Common issues include null reference exceptions in the ScriptableRenderPass code, incorrect use of CommandBuffer methods (like Blitter.BlitTexture), or shaders within the pass failing to compile or find required input textures.4 Temporarily disabling custom renderer features one by one can help isolate a problematic feature.


Shader Compatibility: Shaders written for Unity's Built-in Render Pipeline are not directly compatible with URP. If custom shaders are being used (e.g., to visualize the segmentation mask), they must be authored specifically for URP (e.g., using URP's shader library includes) or created using Shader Graph. Incompatible shaders often render as magenta, but a critical failure in a shader essential for the first screen draw (or a custom pass that fails due to a shader issue) could contribute to a black screen.6


Missing Input Textures in URP Passes: Custom renderer features or post-processing effects often rely on specific input textures, such as the camera's color buffer (_CameraColorTexture) or depth buffer (_CameraDepthTexture). If these textures are not available at the point the custom pass executes, or if they are referenced incorrectly (e.g., wrong RenderTargetHandle), the pass may fail or produce black output.4 The Unity Frame Debugger is an invaluable tool for inspecting the inputs and outputs of each render pass in URP.

The integration of Sentis output (which might be a RenderTexture containing the segmentation mask) with URP's rendering flow is a particularly sensitive point. A misconfigured URP custom pass attempting to process or display this Sentis-generated texture could easily disrupt the overall rendering. For instance, if a ScriptableRenderPass is designed to take the segmentation mask from Sentis, apply effects, and then blit it to the screen, any failure in sourcing the mask texture, in the shader used for effects, or in the final blit operation could lead to a black screen or missing visuals.2 Debugging in such cases requires tracing the data flow from the Sentis output, through any intermediate URP passes, to the final camera target.2.3. AR-Specific Checks (Conditional: If the project involves Augmented Reality)If the remalux-new-sentis project incorporates Augmented Reality (AR) functionalities, for example, using AR Foundation, several AR-specific factors can cause a black screen.

Camera Permissions: AR applications inherently require access to the device's camera. On mobile platforms (iOS, Android), this access is permission-gated. If the application does not correctly request camera permissions, or if the user denies them, the AR system cannot initialize the camera feed, often resulting in a black screen.8 Ensure the Android Manifest (for Android) or Info.plist (for iOS) contains the necessary permission declarations and that the application logic requests these permissions at runtime.


AR Session Initialization: AR frameworks like AR Foundation rely on components such as ARSession, ARCameraManager, and platform-specific loader settings (e.g., ARCore XR Plug-in Management for Android, ARKit XR Plug-in Management for iOS). Misconfiguration of these components, failure to initialize the XR subsystem, or errors during the AR session's startup sequence can prevent the camera feed from being displayed.10 Console logs should be checked for any errors related to XR initialization or AR session state.


Device Compatibility: Not all devices support AR. The target device must be compatible with the AR framework being used (e.g., ARCore for supported Android devices, ARKit for supported iOS devices).9 Attempting to run an AR application on an unsupported device will likely lead to initialization failures and a black screen. Official lists of supported devices are typically provided by Google (for ARCore) and Apple (for ARKit).


Tracking Issues: While severe tracking failures or an inability to detect environmental features usually result in a frozen or unstable AR experience rather than a persistent black screen from startup, underlying issues that prevent tracking from starting at all could be linked to broader AR system initialization problems.

In an AR context, the AR system typically manages the camera feed. If this system fails to initialize correctly (due to permissions, compatibility, or configuration), the primary visual input for the application is lost. Sentis would usually process frames derived from this AR camera feed. Thus, if an AR black screen occurs, troubleshooting the AR setup (AR Foundation, XR Plug-in Management, device settings) should generally precede deep dives into Sentis, unless console logs specifically implicate Sentis in the AR initialization failure.The following table summarizes common causes for a black screen in Unity and initial steps for verification:Table 1: Common Unity Black Screen Root Causes & Solutions

Check XR Plug-in Management settings. Examine console logs for AR-specific initialization errors. 10
Addressing these potential causes systematically should help identify why a black screen is occurring. If the black screen persists after these checks, or if console logs point directly to Sentis-related problems, the investigation should proceed to Phase 2.3. Phase 2: Tackling Sentis Integration and Log Errors – The Core of the ProblemWith foundational Unity checks addressed, the focus shifts to the Unity Sentis integration itself. Errors in the console logs, particularly those related to Sentis, are strong indicators of where the problems lie. This phase will cover Sentis setup, API versioning, model management, input preparation, worker configuration, and log interpretation.3.1. Verifying Sentis Setup and Versioning: The FoundationCorrect Sentis package installation and compatibility with the Unity version are fundamental. Furthermore, Sentis has undergone significant API changes, notably between version 1.x and 2.x, which can be a major source of errors if code is not updated.

Sentis Package Version: The version of the com.unity.sentis package installed in the project (via Window > Package Manager) should be verified. Different documentation snippets reference various 2.x versions.11 It is generally advisable to use a recent, stable release.


Unity Version Compatibility: Sentis package versions have specific Unity editor version requirements. For example, 16 notes that Unity Sentis generally requires Unity 2023 or above, while a specific Meta sample using Sentis 2.1.1 was built with Unity 2022.3.58f1.11 The project's Unity version must be compatible with the installed Sentis package version. This information is typically available in the Sentis package documentation or changelogs.


API Upgrades - Critical Focus on TensorFloat vs. Tensor<float>: This is one of the most significant breaking changes.

Sentis 1.x and earlier versions used specific classes like TensorFloat for tensors containing floating-point data and TensorInt for integer data.
Sentis 2.x and later versions transitioned to generic tensor types: Tensor<float> and Tensor<int>.12
If the remalux-new-sentis project is using Sentis 2.x, all code interacting with tensors must use these generic versions. Any remaining usage of the old TensorFloat or TensorInt types will lead to compilation errors or, more subtly, runtime TypeLoadException or MethodNotFoundException if old compiled code or incorrect API calls persist.
It is worth noting that some external documentation or older examples might still refer to TensorFloat even in a Sentis 2.x context.27 This potential for confusion underscores the importance of adhering strictly to the official Sentis 2.x API for tensor manipulation.



API Upgrades - Worker Creation: The mechanism for creating an inference worker has also changed.

Sentis 1.x used a factory pattern: IWorker worker = WorkerFactory.CreateWorker(backendType, runtimeModel);. The worker was typically referenced via the IWorker interface.
Sentis 2.x uses direct instantiation: Worker worker = new Worker(runtimeModel, backendType); (or an overload taking DeviceType). The IWorker interface has been largely replaced by the concrete Worker class.12



Other Notable API Changes: Several other method names and patterns were updated. The upgrade guides 12 are the authoritative sources for these changes. Key examples include:

worker.Execute(input) changed to worker.Schedule(input).
tensor.ToReadOnlyArray() changed to tensor.DownloadToArray().
worker.ExecuteLayerByLayer changed to worker.ScheduleIterable().
BackendType.GPUCommandBuffer was effectively superseded by BackendType.GPUCompute.


The transition from Sentis 1.x to 2.x involved substantial API modifications that are not backward compatible. If the "remalux-new-sentis" project is indeed new but has incorporated code snippets, tutorials, or assets from the Sentis 1.x era, these API mismatches are highly probable sources of the observed errors and the black screen. For instance, attempting to instantiate TensorFloat or call WorkerFactory.CreateWorker when using a Sentis 2.x library will fail. While some of these would result in compile-time errors, others (like attempting to call a method that no longer exists on a correctly typed object due to subtle linking issues or reflection) could manifest as runtime exceptions, halting script execution and preventing Sentis from initializing correctly. This, in turn, can easily lead to a black screen and the absence of any segmentation output. A meticulous review of the project's codebase against the Sentis 2.x API is therefore a critical first step in resolving Sentis-related errors.The following table provides a migration guide for some of the most common API changes between Sentis 1.x and Sentis 2.x:Table 2: Key Sentis API Migration Guide (Sentis 1.x to 2.x)

3.2. Model Management and Loading: Getting the Neural Network ReadyThe neural network model itself must be correctly formatted, stored, and loaded for Sentis to use it.

Model Format: Sentis primarily works with models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format, which typically have an .onnx file extension. Unity can import these .onnx files and convert them into its internal .sentis format, or .sentis files can be used directly if they have been pre-converted.16 It's crucial that the model file is not corrupted and is in a format that the installed Sentis version can parse.


Model Location and Pathing:

StreamingAssets Folder: A common and recommended practice for storing model files (especially raw .onnx files that will be loaded at runtime) is to place them in the Assets/StreamingAssets folder.16 Files in this folder are copied to the build target as-is, without Unity's usual asset import processing. They are typically accessed using a path constructed from Application.streamingAssetsPath. For example: string modelPath = Application.streamingAssetsPath + "/your_model_name.onnx";.
Platform-Specific Handling for StreamingAssets: Accessing files from StreamingAssets is not uniform across all platforms.

On Android, Application.streamingAssetsPath points to a path inside the compressed APK or AAB file (e.g., jar:file:///...). Direct file system access using this path (e.g., with System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes) will fail. Instead, UnityEngine.Networking.UnityWebRequest must be used to read the file data.17 This typically involves creating a UnityWebRequest for the path, sending it, and then retrieving the downloadHandler.data once completed. This byte array can then be used with model loading mechanisms that accept byte arrays.
On WebGL, direct file system access is not available, so StreamingAssets cannot be accessed via file paths in the same way as on desktop platforms.18 UnityWebRequest is also the standard method here.
Failure to handle these platform differences correctly is a common cause of "model not found" errors at runtime, even if the path appears correct during editor testing.


Resources Folder: An alternative is to place model files (often after Unity converts them to .sentis assets, which become ModelAsset types) in a folder named Resources (e.g., Assets/Resources). These can then be loaded using Resources.Load<ModelAsset>("model_name_without_extension").19 This method embeds the asset into the build, which can increase initial load times and build size, but simplifies pathing.18 This is more typical for .sentis files that have been through Unity's import pipeline.
Direct Asset Reference: If an .onnx or .sentis file is imported into the Assets folder (outside of StreamingAssets or Resources), Unity may process it into a ModelAsset. Such an asset can be assigned to a public ModelAsset field in a script via the Inspector, and then loaded from that reference.



Model Loading with ModelLoader:

The primary class for loading models into a runtime format that Sentis can use is ModelLoader.
If using a ModelAsset (obtained via Resources.Load or an Inspector assignment), the loading process is typically:
C#public ModelAsset modelAsset; // Assign in Inspector or load via Resources
Model runtimeModel;
//...
runtimeModel = ModelLoader.Load(modelAsset); [19, 20]


If loading an ONNX model from a byte array (e.g., read from StreamingAssets using UnityWebRequest):
C#byte modelData = //... get byte array from UnityWebRequest...
Model runtimeModel = ModelLoader.Load(modelData);


It is crucial to check that runtimeModel is not null after the load attempt, as a null value indicates a loading failure.



Model Integrity and Compatibility: The ONNX model itself might be the source of issues.

It could be corrupted.
It might use an ONNX opset version that is too new or too old for the installed Sentis version. Sentis documentation or changelogs usually specify supported opset versions.21
The model might contain specific operators (layers) that are not supported by the Sentis version or by the chosen backend. 21 lists many fixes for specific operators, implying that operator support is an ongoing development. Tools like Netron can be used to visualize the ONNX model structure and inspect its operators and opset version.


The choice between Resources and StreamingAssets for model storage, coupled with the platform-specific access requirements for StreamingAssets, presents a subtle but critical detail. If a project developed and tested on a desktop platform (where direct file access to StreamingAssets works) is then built for Android without adapting the loading mechanism to use UnityWebRequest, the model loading will silently fail. This failure will prevent the runtimeModel from being created, which in turn will cause the Worker instantiation to fail, leading to errors in the log and likely a black screen or non-functional application. If the remalux-new-sentis project targets Android or WebGL, its model loading code for StreamingAssets must be carefully reviewed.3.3. Input Tensor Preparation: Feeding the Model CorrectlyNeural networks are highly sensitive to the format of their input data. Providing data in an incorrect shape, type, or normalization range is a common reason for models producing erroneous or no output, even if Sentis itself executes without throwing exceptions.

Understanding Model Input Requirements: Before creating any input tensor, it is essential to know what the neural network expects. This information typically includes:

Shape: The dimensions of the input tensor, usually expressed as (batch size, channels, height, width) for NCHW layout, or (batch size, height, width, channels) for NHWC layout.13 For a wall segmentation model processing images, this might be, for example, (1, 3, 256, 256) if it takes a single 3-channel (RGB) image of size 256x256.
Data Type: Usually 32-bit floating-point numbers (float) for image data.
Normalization Scheme: Pixel values often need to be scaled (e.g., from 0-255 range to 0-1 or -1 to 1). Many models also require mean subtraction and division by standard deviation, specific to the dataset they were trained on (e.g., ImageNet normalization).
This information should be available from the model's documentation, its source, or can be inferred by inspecting the ONNX file with tools like Netron.22



Converting Texture to Tensor: For image-based models, Unity's Texture2D (e.g., from a camera feed, webcam, or an imported image file) is often the source of input data.

The TextureConverter.ToTensor static method is used for this conversion:
C#public Texture2D inputTexture; // Source texture
//...
// Ensure inputTexture is readable (check import settings for assets)
Tensor<float> inputTensor = TextureConverter.ToTensor(inputTexture); [23, 24]

Note: Older examples might show TensorFloat as the return type 19, but with Sentis 2.x, it is Tensor<float>.
TextureConverter.ToTensor has overloads that allow specifying the desired output tensor's width, height, and number of channels. This is useful if the source texture needs to be resized to match the model's expected input dimensions.23 For example:
Tensor<float> inputTensor = TextureConverter.ToTensor(inputTexture, targetWidth, targetHeight, targetChannels);
The TextureTransform struct can be passed to TextureConverter.ToTensor for more advanced control, such as channel swizzling (e.g., converting RGB to BGR if the model expects that order) or precise scaling and cropping.24



Data Type and Normalization:

TextureConverter.ToTensor typically converts pixel values from their 0-255 integer range (if that's the source texture format) or 0-1 float range into a Tensor<float> with values normalized to the 0-1 range.
If the model requires a different normalization (e.g., -1 to 1, or specific per-channel mean/std normalization), this preprocessing must be implemented manually. This can be done by:

Operating on the Tensor<float> data after ToTensor (if the tensor is on the CPU or brought to CPU via ReadbackAndClone).
Modifying the neural network model itself to include these normalization layers using the Sentis functional API.
Writing a custom compute shader to perform normalization on the GPU.





Tensor Shape and Layout (NHWC vs. NCHW):

Sentis's TextureConverter.ToTensor defaults to creating tensors in the NCHW (batch, channels, height, width) layout.24
If the neural network expects the NHWC layout, a transpose operation will be necessary. This can be achieved by adding a transpose layer to the model using the Sentis functional API or by manually reordering the data if constructing the tensor from a raw data array. The expected layout is a critical piece of information from the model's specification.13



Creating Tensors from Arrays: If the input data is already available as a C# array (e.g., float), a tensor can be created directly:
C#TensorShape shape = new TensorShape(batch, channels, height, width);
float dataArray = //... your data...
Tensor<float> inputTensor = new Tensor<float>(shape, dataArray); [22]


A mismatch between the prepared input tensor and the model's expectations is a frequent and often insidious cause of failure. The model might execute without errors but produce garbage output (e.g., an all-black segmentation mask or random noise) if the input data is incorrectly shaped, scaled, or ordered. This could directly explain why "segmentation is not visible." For the remalux-new-sentis project, it is imperative to meticulously verify the entire input preparation pipeline against the specific requirements of the wall segmentation model being used. This involves more than just successfully calling TextureConverter.ToTensor; it requires ensuring the semantic correctness of the resulting tensor data.3.4. Sentis Worker Configuration and Execution: Running the InferenceOnce the model is loaded and the input tensor is prepared, an inference engine, called a "worker" in Sentis, is needed to execute the model.

Worker Creation: In Sentis 2.x, a worker is created by instantiating the Worker class:
C#Model runtimeModel; // Previously loaded
BackendType backendType = BackendType.GPUCompute; // Or CPU, GPUPixel
Worker worker = new Worker(runtimeModel, backendType); [14, 15]

It's good practice to dispose of the worker when it's no longer needed: worker.Dispose();.


Backend Selection (BackendType): The backendType parameter determines where and how the model will be executed.

BackendType.GPUCompute: This is generally the fastest option for complex models, utilizing compute shaders for execution on the GPU. It requires that the target device supports compute shaders (SystemInfo.supportsComputeShaders). On Windows with DirectX12, Sentis can leverage DirectML for further acceleration if available.15 Tensor data typically resides in GPU memory with this backend.13
BackendType.CPU: Executes the model on the CPU using code compiled by Unity's Burst compiler. This is a reliable fallback if GPU execution is problematic or for tasks where GPU overhead isn't justified. Performance can be significantly slower than GPUCompute for large models. On WebGL, Burst compiles to WebAssembly, which may result in slower execution.15 Tensor data resides in CPU memory.
BackendType.GPUPixel: Uses pixel shaders for execution on the GPU. This is typically slower than GPUCompute and is intended as a fallback for platforms that do not support compute shaders.15
The choice of backend impacts performance, resource usage, and where tensor data is primarily stored. An inappropriate backend might lead to very slow inference, making the application unresponsive.



Executing the Model (Scheduling Inference):

Input tensors are provided to the worker. If the model has a single, default input, it can be passed directly to the Schedule method. If the model has multiple named inputs, they can be set using worker.SetInput("input_name_in_model", inputTensor); for each input.
Execution is initiated by calling one of the Schedule methods on the worker.12 For example:
C#Tensor<float> inputTensor; // Prepared input
// For a model with a single default input:
worker.Schedule(inputTensor);

// Or, if inputs were set by name:
// worker.SetInput("input_0", inputTensor1);
// worker.SetInput("input_1", inputTensor2);
// worker.Schedule();


The Schedule method is asynchronous. It queues the work for execution on the selected backend and returns immediately, without waiting for the inference to complete.



Retrieving Output:

After scheduling, the output tensor(s) can be retrieved using worker.PeekOutput(). If the model has multiple outputs, they can be accessed by name or index: worker.PeekOutput("output_name_in_model") or worker.PeekOutput(index).14
PeekOutput is non-blocking and returns a Tensor object. This tensor often references data that is still on the GPU (if a GPU backend is used) and may not yet be finalized if inference is ongoing. The returned tensor reference is typically valid until the next Schedule call or until the worker is disposed.
To access the tensor data on the CPU (e.g., for processing in C# scripts or for debugging), the data must be explicitly read back from the GPU. This is done using outputTensor.ReadbackAndClone() or outputTensor.ReadbackAndCloneAsync(). The synchronous ReadbackAndClone() will block until the data is available and copied, while the asynchronous version allows the main thread to continue working.26
C#// Assuming 'outputTensor' was obtained from PeekOutput()
Tensor<float> cpuOutputTensor = outputTensor.ReadbackAndClone();
// Now cpuOutputTensor.ToTensorArray() or direct indexing can be used if it's a CPUTensorData based tensor.
// Or, for direct access to the array if it's already CPU-backed or after ReadbackAndClone:
// float data = cpuOutputTensor.ToReadOnlyArray(); // Old API
float data = cpuOutputTensor.DownloadToArray(); // New API [12]


A common pattern for object detection models, as seen in 27, is for the model to return multiple tensors, such as one for bounding box coordinates (TensorFloat in that example, should be Tensor<float>) and another for class IDs (TensorInt, should be Tensor<int>). Segmentation models might output a primary mask tensor and potentially other auxiliary tensors.



Error Handling: It is crucial to wrap Sentis operations—such as ModelLoader.Load, new Worker, worker.Schedule, worker.PeekOutput, and tensor.ReadbackAndClone—in try-catch blocks. This allows the application to gracefully handle potential runtime exceptions, such as model incompatibility, out-of-memory errors, or issues during backend execution.

Understanding the asynchronous nature of worker.Schedule() and the distinction between GPU-resident tensor data (from PeekOutput with GPU backends) and CPU-accessible data (after ReadbackAndClone) is critical. Attempting to directly access the data array of a GPU tensor from C# without a readback operation will result in errors or significantly stall the application. Similarly, trying to use the output immediately after calling Schedule in the same frame without a proper synchronization mechanism (like waiting for ReadbackAndCloneAsync to complete or checking a fence) can lead to using stale or incomplete data.3.5. Deciphering Sentis Logs: Common Errors and WarningsThe Unity console log is a primary tool for diagnosing Sentis issues. Sentis often provides informative error messages when problems occur.

Enable Verbose Logging (If Available): Some libraries offer settings to increase log verbosity. While not explicitly detailed for Sentis in the provided materials, checking Sentis package settings or advanced project settings for any relevant logging levels might yield more detailed diagnostic information.


Common Error Types and Interpretation:

Model Loading Errors:

Messages like "Model file not found at path..." indicate an issue with how the model file is being located or accessed (see Section 3.2 on StreamingAssets and platform pathing).
"Failed to parse ONNX model," "Error deserializing model," or "Unsupported ONNX opset version" point to problems with the model file itself—it might be corrupted, use an ONNX version incompatible with the current Sentis, or contain structural issues.21
"Operator 'XYZ' is not supported" means the model contains a neural network layer type that Sentis cannot execute (possibly on the selected backend).


Worker Creation Errors:

"BackendType 'XYZ' not supported on this platform" or errors related to compute shader compilation indicate that the chosen backend (e.g., GPUCompute) is not viable on the current hardware/software configuration.
"Failed to compile model for backend 'XYZ'" suggests an incompatibility between the model's operations and the backend's capabilities.


Input/Output Errors:

"Input tensor shape mismatch": The tensor provided to worker.Schedule() or worker.SetInput() does not have the dimensions the model expects.
"Input tensor data type mismatch": The data type of the input tensor (e.g., float, int) does not match the model's input layer.
Errors related to output tensor shape, like "NonMaxSuppression output tensor has correct shape" being listed as a fix in 21, imply that incorrect output shapes were a past issue for certain operations.


Execution Errors:

"Out of memory on GPU/CPU" indicates the model and its intermediate tensors require more memory than available.
Errors reported from specific layers during execution 21 point to issues within the model's structure or its interaction with the backend implementation for that layer.


Tensor API Misuse:

TypeLoadException or MethodNotFoundException can occur if Sentis 1.x API calls (e.g., using TensorFloat) are present in a project using Sentis 2.x.
Null reference exceptions can happen if tensor objects are used before being properly initialized or after being disposed. 21 notes a fix for "CPU Tensors were not properly disposed," suggesting that improper disposal could lead to issues.





Cross-referencing with Sentis Changelogs: The Sentis changelogs are an invaluable, though often overlooked, troubleshooting resource. 21 provides an extensive list of fixes and changes for various Sentis versions. When encountering an error message or unexpected behavior:

Check the changelog for the specific Sentis version being used (and recent preceding versions).
Many obscure error messages or behaviors might correspond to known bugs that have been fixed in a particular version. If the project is using an older Sentis version, upgrading might resolve the issue.
For example, 21 lists fixes such as "Improved CPU backend performance," "Reduced memory usage when serializing... large models," "Shader issues on XBOX," "CPU Tensors were not properly disposed," "Reshaping of empty tensor," "Error messages for model deserialization," "Slice inference issues," "Fixed MatMul for 1D input tensors," and "Fixed Conv operator going out of bounds on GPUCompute and GPUCommandBuffer." If the remalux-new-sentis project's logs contain errors related to these areas, the changelog can confirm if it was a known issue and in which version it was addressed.


Systematically analyzing Sentis logs, especially when combined with the information in the official changelogs, provides a direct path to diagnosing many problems. Many issues that seem perplexing at first are often documented as fixed bugs or are consequences of documented API changes.The following table offers interpretations for some common Sentis-related log messages or problematic behaviors:Table 3: Interpreting Common Sentis Log Messages/Issues

Review output tensor interpretation and visualization logic (Phase 3)."GPUPixel now reuses RenderTextures reducing garbage collection."21 Not an error, but an optimization in Sentis.Be aware of this behavior if using the GPUPixel backend; it might affect how RenderTexture objects are managed or appear in memory profiling."Error message for importing incompatible Sentis models."21 Sentis has improved error reporting for this scenario.If this message appears, the .sentis file being imported is likely from a different, incompatible version of Sentis. Re-import the original ONNX model or re-serialize the model using the current Sentis version.
By methodically addressing these areas—Sentis versioning and API compliance, model loading, input preparation, worker execution, and log analysis—the root causes of the errors and warnings in the remalux-new-sentis project can be identified and rectified.4. Phase 3: Enabling Wall Segmentation Visualization – Seeing the ResultsOnce the Sentis pipeline is executing without critical errors, the next challenge is to correctly interpret and visualize the output from the wall segmentation model. The "segmentation not visible" issue often stems from misinterpreting the model's raw tensor output or from errors in the rendering process used to display the segmentation mask.4.1. Interpreting the Segmentation Model's Output Tensor(s)The raw output of a segmentation model is numerical data in a tensor format, not a directly viewable image. Understanding its structure is key.

Understanding Segmentation Output Structure:

Binary Segmentation: If the model distinguishes only one class (e.g., "wall" vs. "not-wall"), the output might be a 2D tensor with dimensions corresponding to the input image's height and width (e.g., H x W). Each element in this tensor would typically represent the probability or logit (unnormalized log probability) of the corresponding pixel belonging to the "wall" class. The shape could also include batch and channel dimensions, such as 1 x H x W x 1 (for NHWC-like single channel) or 1 x 1 x H x W (for NCHW-like single channel).
Multi-Class Segmentation: If the model can identify multiple types of objects or surfaces, the output is often a 3D tensor. Common shapes are NumClasses x Height x Width (if channel-first, like NCHW) or Height x Width x NumClasses (if channel-last, like NHWC). In this case, each "slice" or "channel" along the class dimension corresponds to one specific class, and the values represent the probability/logit for that class at each pixel.
It's important to consult the model's documentation or inspect its output layer (e.g., using Netron) to confirm the exact shape and layout. Some models might produce multiple output tensors; for instance, 27 describes a YOLO object detection model returning two tensors: one for coordinates and another for class IDs. A segmentation model would typically output at least one primary tensor representing the pixel-wise mask.



Output Shape and Data Range:

After obtaining the output tensor (e.g., Tensor<float> outputTensor = worker.PeekOutput().ReadbackAndClone();), its shape can be inspected using outputTensor.shape.
The data values are usually floats. If these are raw logits, they might range widely (e.g., negative to positive infinity). To convert logits to probabilities (0 to 1 range), a softmax function typically needs to be applied across the class dimension. If the model's final layer already includes a softmax or sigmoid (for binary segmentation), the output values might already be in the 0-1 probability range.
For multi-class segmentation, an "argmax" operation is often performed on the CPU or GPU (e.g., via a custom shader or Sentis functional API layer if added to the model) across the class dimension of the output tensor. This identifies the class with the highest probability for each pixel, resulting in a 2D tensor of class indices.



Accessing Data: Once the output tensor is on the CPU (e.g., after ReadbackAndClone()), its data can be accessed. For a Tensor<float> cpuTensor, individual elements can be read using multi-dimensional indexing like cpuTensor[batch, channel, y, x] or by first converting the tensor's data to a flat array using cpuTensor.DownloadToArray() 12 and then calculating the correct 1D index based on the tensor's shape and strides.

The raw numerical output from the model requires careful interpretation. For example, simply taking a multi-class output tensor and trying to display it as an image will likely result in a meaningless visual. The data needs to be processed—such as by applying softmax, performing an argmax, or selecting a specific class channel—before it can be meaningfully translated into a visual segmentation mask.4.2. Techniques for Rendering Segmentation Masks: From Tensor to VisualsOnce the output tensor is understood, it needs to be rendered. Sentis provides utilities, and custom shaders offer more flexibility.

Using TextureConverter.ToTexture / RenderToTexture: These are often the most straightforward methods if the output tensor is already on the GPU or if a GPU-based visualization is desired.26

RenderTexture rt = TextureConverter.ToTexture(outputTensor); creates a new RenderTexture from the tensor data.
TextureConverter.RenderToTexture(outputTensor, existingRenderTexture); writes the tensor data into a pre-existing RenderTexture.
Crucial Role of TextureTransform: For segmentation masks, especially those that are single-channel (binary segmentation) or where only one class from a multi-class output is being visualized, TextureTransform is essential for correct visual representation.25

If outputTensor is a single-channel tensor (e.g., shape H x W or 1 x 1 x H x W), TextureConverter.ToTexture might by default map this data only to the red (R) channel of the output RenderTexture. To display this as a grayscale mask, the SetBroadcastChannels(true) option in TextureTransform can be used. This will broadcast the single channel's value to the R, G, and B channels of the texture (e.g., R maps to (R, R, R, A)).
C#TextureTransform transform = new TextureTransform().SetBroadcastChannels(true);
RenderTexture maskTexture = TextureConverter.ToTexture(outputTensor, transform);


Alternatively, SetChannelColorMask can be used to assign specific colors based on tensor channels or to make only certain channels visible. For instance, to visualize a single-channel mask as red, one might configure the transform to use the tensor's first channel for red and set green and blue to zero.
The resulting RenderTexture can then be displayed using a UI RawImage component, applied as the main texture to a material on a 3D Quad, or used as an input to a URP post-processing effect or custom render pass.





Using TextureConverter.RenderToScreen: This method directly blits the tensor data to the screen.26 It can be useful for quick debugging or full-screen effects. However, when using URP or HDRP, it should typically be called within specific render pipeline callbacks like RenderPipelineManager.endFrameRendering to ensure it integrates correctly with the pipeline. The tensor data might need remapping if its values are not in the 0-1 range (e.g., if the model outputs values from 0 to 255, these would appear overly bright or clipped).26


Custom Shaders: For more advanced visualization—such as color-coding different classes from a multi-class segmentation, blending the mask with the scene, applying thresholds dynamically, or creating visual effects—custom shaders are necessary.

The RenderTexture obtained from TextureConverter.ToTexture can be passed as an input (e.g., _MaskTex) to a custom material using this shader.
The shader would then sample this mask texture. For example, a simple thresholding shader might sample the (grayscale) mask; if the sampled value is above a certain threshold, it outputs a specific color (e.g., translucent red for the wall), otherwise, it outputs a transparent color or the original scene color.
If URP is used, any custom shaders must be URP-compatible (e.g., written using URP shader libraries or Shader Graph).6



CPU-Side Pixel Manipulation (Generally Less Performant for Real-time):

After getting the tensor data to the CPU using outputTensor.ReadbackAndClone() and cpuTensor.DownloadToArray(), it's possible to iterate through the data.
A new Texture2D can be created on the CPU (e.g., Texture2D displayTexture = new Texture2D(width, height);).
Pixel colors can be set using displayTexture.SetPixel(x, y, color) or more efficiently with displayTexture.SetPixels(colorArray). The color would be determined based on the tensor values (e.g., mapping a probability to a grayscale value or a class index to a specific color).
Finally, displayTexture.Apply() must be called to upload the modified pixel data from CPU memory to GPU memory so the texture can be rendered. This entire process (readback, CPU iteration, SetPixels, Apply) is generally too slow for real-time, per-frame updates of large textures but can be useful for debugging, generating static visualizations, or very small masks.


The "no segmentation visible" problem frequently arises not because the model fails to produce a mask, but because the raw tensor output is not being translated into a visually interpretable format correctly. For instance, if a single-channel output tensor (representing wall probabilities) is converted to an RGBA RenderTexture without a proper TextureTransform, the mask data might only populate the red channel. If the material or UI element displaying this texture expects a grayscale image across RGB or uses the alpha channel for visibility, the mask could appear black, invisible, or as an unintended color. Emphasizing the correct use of TextureTransform with TextureConverter.ToTexture is therefore critical for successfully visualizing segmentation masks.4.3. Troubleshooting Missing or Incorrect SegmentationIf segmentation is still not visible or appears incorrect after attempting visualization, further troubleshooting is needed:

Verify Input to Visualization Stage:

Is the tensor being passed to TextureConverter (or a custom shader) indeed the correct output tensor from the model? If the model has multiple outputs, ensure the one containing the segmentation mask is selected.
After ReadbackAndClone(), log some values from the output tensor data array. Are they all zeros? Are they in an expected range? This helps confirm if the model is producing any meaningful output before visualization is attempted.



Shader/Material Issues:

UI RawImage: If using a UnityEngine.UI.RawImage to display the RenderTexture, ensure the RenderTexture is assigned to its Texture property. Also, check that the RawImage GameObject is active, its RectTransform is positioned and sized correctly within the canvas, and it's not being obscured by other UI elements. Its color and material properties should also be checked (e.g., color alpha should be non-zero).
Material on a Quad/Mesh: If rendering the RenderTexture onto a 3D object (like a quad acting as a screen overlay), ensure the material assigned to the quad is appropriate. For simple texture display, an Unlit shader (e.g., Unlit/Texture for Built-in RP, or a URP Unlit shader) is suitable. The RenderTexture should be assigned to the material's main texture property (often _MainTex). The quad itself must be correctly positioned, rotated, and scaled in front of the camera and within its view frustum.
Custom Shader: If a custom shader is used, check for any compilation errors in the console. Verify the shader logic: Are texture coordinates (UVs) being handled correctly? Is the sampling of the mask texture correct? Is the thresholding or color mapping logic implemented as intended?.6 The Unity Frame Debugger can be very helpful here to inspect shader inputs and outputs.



Alpha Blending and Transparency: If the segmentation mask is intended to be overlaid transparently onto the main camera view, the material and shader used for rendering the mask must support transparency (e.g., by having a "Transparent" rendering queue and appropriate ZWrite/Blend settings). The alpha channel of the mask texture (or the color logic in the shader determining transparency) must be set up correctly.


Render Order / Occlusion (URP): If using URP, especially with custom ScriptableRendererFeatures or ScriptableRenderPasses to inject the mask rendering, the timing of this pass (RenderPassEvent) is crucial. The mask rendering should typically occur after the main scene opaque objects, and potentially after skybox/transparent objects, depending on the desired effect. Ensure it's not being cleared by a subsequent camera clear operation or occluded by other full-screen effects.5


Data Range Mismatch for Visualization: TextureConverter.ToTexture and simple Unlit shaders generally expect input texture values to be in the 0 to 1 range for direct visual mapping. If the model's output tensor contains logits (which can be outside 0-1) or values in a different range (e.g., 0-255), the resulting texture might appear entirely black, entirely white, or have very poor contrast. 26 mentions that if an image rendered via RenderToScreen is too bright, the tensor values might be 0-255 instead of 0-1, requiring remapping. This remapping or normalization step might need to be performed on the tensor data before visualization (e.g., using Sentis functional API to add normalization layers to the model, or in a custom shader).

Visualizing segmentation is a multi-step process: model inference produces a tensor, this tensor is interpreted and converted to a texture, and finally, this texture is rendered using materials and shaders. A failure at any of these stages will lead to no visible segmentation. A systematic "trace the data" approach is recommended:
Confirm the model's output tensor (after readback) contains plausible data (log some values).
Confirm that TextureConverter.ToTexture (with appropriate TextureTransform) produces a RenderTexture that, when inspected (e.g., by assigning it to a public field and viewing the preview in the Inspector), shows some expected visual pattern.
Confirm this RenderTexture is correctly assigned to a visible UI element or a material on a mesh that is in the camera's view.
If a custom shader is involved, use the Frame Debugger to inspect its inputs and ensure it's processing the mask texture as expected.
5. Systematic Debugging Strategy for remalux-new-sentisTo effectively tackle the multifaceted issues in the remalux-new-sentis project, a systematic, reductionist debugging approach is recommended over random changes. This strategy aims to isolate the point of failure within the complex Unity-Sentis pipeline.

Step 1: Simplify and Isolate.

Begin by creating a new, minimal Unity scene. In this scene, attempt to load and run the Sentis model using a static, known input image (e.g., a Texture2D imported into the project and known to be suitable for the model). This removes complexities associated with live camera feeds, AR systems, or intricate URP setups. The goal is to get the core Sentis inference working in the simplest possible context.



Step 2: Check Logs Religiously.

Upon running the simplified scene (and the main project), immediately examine the Unity console. Prioritize resolving all red error messages, especially those that appear at startup or during the Sentis initialization phases (model loading, worker creation). Warnings should also be investigated, as they can sometimes indicate underlying problems.



Step 3: Verify Sentis API Compliance.

This is a high-priority step. Conduct a thorough review of all C# scripts that interact with the Sentis API. Compare the code against the API changes detailed in Table 2 (Section 3.1), particularly focusing on:

Usage of Tensor<float> and Tensor<int> instead of TensorFloat and TensorInt.
Worker creation using new Worker(model, backendType) instead of WorkerFactory.CreateWorker.
Using worker.Schedule() instead of worker.Execute().
Using tensor.DownloadToArray() instead of tensor.ToReadOnlyArray().


Mismatches here are a very common source of critical runtime errors that can lead to black screens or non-functional Sentis behavior.



Step 4: Confirm Model Loading.

Insert Debug.Log statements into the model loading script to verify:

The path to the model file (if loaded by path from StreamingAssets) is correct for the target platform.
If using UnityWebRequest for StreamingAssets, that the request completes successfully and downloadHandler.data is not null or empty.
ModelLoader.Load(...) returns a non-null Model object (the runtimeModel).
The subsequent new Worker(...) call also succeeds and returns a non-null Worker object.





Step 5: Validate Input Tensor.

Before calling worker.Schedule(), log the shape (inputTensor.shape.ToString()) and a small sample of values from the prepared input tensor.
Ensure these match the model's documented input requirements (dimensions, data range, channel order).
If using TextureConverter.ToTensor, ensure the source Texture2D is readable (check import settings) and consider using overloads that specify target dimensions if resizing is needed.



Step 6: Inspect Raw Output Tensor.

After worker.Schedule() has likely completed (for simple tests, a small delay or checking in a subsequent frame might be sufficient, or use ReadbackAndClone() which blocks), retrieve the output tensor.
Perform outputTensor.ReadbackAndClone() to get a CPU-accessible copy.
Log the shape and a sample of values from this CPU-side output tensor.

Is it all zeros? This might indicate an issue with the model itself or grossly incorrect input.
Does it have the expected number of dimensions and channels for a segmentation mask?





Step 7: Test Basic Visualization.

Attempt to render the CPU-side output tensor (or the GPU tensor directly if appropriate) to a simple UI RawImage.
Use TextureConverter.ToTexture(outputTensor, appropriateTextureTransform) to convert the tensor to a RenderTexture. Ensure appropriateTextureTransform is configured correctly for the mask type (e.g., new TextureTransform().SetBroadcastChannels(true) for a grayscale view of a single-channel mask).
Assign this RenderTexture to the RawImage's texture slot.
If this basic visualization works, it confirms that the core Sentis pipeline (load, input, process, output, basic conversion) is functional.



Step 8: Incrementally Add Complexity.

Once the simplified test works, gradually reintroduce elements from the original remalux-new-sentis project. For example:

Switch from a static input image to a live camera feed.
If URP is used, re-enable custom renderer features or shaders one by one.
Implement more complex mask visualization shaders.


Test thoroughly at each step to pinpoint where a problem might be reintroduced.



Step 9: Utilize Unity Tools.

Frame Debugger: Invaluable for diagnosing rendering issues, especially in URP or when custom shaders are involved. It allows inspection of each draw call, render target state, and shader inputs/outputs, helping to see how (or if) the segmentation mask is being rendered within the frame.
Profiler (Window > Analysis > Profiler): Useful for identifying performance bottlenecks (CPU or GPU), excessive memory allocations (which could lead to crashes or instability), or stalls caused by Sentis operations. Pay attention to Sentis-related markers in the profiler timeline.


This systematic approach helps to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. By starting with the simplest configuration and verifying each component of the Sentis pipeline, the specific stage where the failure occurs can be more easily identified. This is generally more effective than making widespread, speculative changes to the codebase.6. Advanced Considerations and Best PracticesBeyond fixing the immediate issues, several advanced considerations and best practices can improve the performance, robustness, and maintainability of Sentis-based applications like remalux-new-sentis.

Optimizing Sentis Performance: Neural network inference can be computationally intensive. Several strategies can help optimize performance, particularly on resource-constrained devices like mobiles or VR headsets 27:

Model Choice: Whenever possible, use the smallest and most efficient model architecture that still meets the project's accuracy requirements. For example, object detection families like YOLO offer variants (e.g., YOLOv8n 'nano' vs. YOLOv8m 'medium'), where smaller versions trade some accuracy for significant speed gains and lower resource usage.27
Quantization: Convert floating-point models (typically FP32) to lower-precision formats like 8-bit integers (UInt8). Quantization can significantly reduce model size (leading to faster load times) and may improve inference speed on hardware that has specialized support for integer operations. Sentis supports quantized models, and 27 explicitly recommends converting models to Sentis format and quantizing to UInt8 to reduce loading times.
Backend Selection: As discussed in Section 3.4, the choice of BackendType (GPUCompute, CPU, GPUPixel) has a major impact. Profile the application on target hardware with different backends to determine the optimal balance of speed and resource consumption.15
Layer-by-Layer Inference (ScheduleIterable): For very large or deep models that might cause a noticeable stall on the main thread if executed all at once, Sentis offers worker.ScheduleIterable(). This allows the inference to be split across multiple frames, executing a few layers at a time, which can improve application responsiveness.12
Minimize CPU-GPU Data Transfers: Moving data between CPU and GPU memory is expensive.

If the model input comes from a GPU source (like a camera texture) and the output is consumed by a GPU process (like a shader for visualization), try to keep all intermediate tensors and operations on the GPU. Select GPUCompute or GPUPixel backends.
If output data needs to be accessed on the CPU, use asynchronous readback methods like tensor.ReadbackAndCloneAsync() instead of the blocking tensor.ReadbackAndClone() to avoid stalling the main thread while waiting for data transfer.26





Ensuring Robust Error Handling:

Implement comprehensive try-catch blocks around all critical Sentis API calls (ModelLoader.Load, new Worker, worker.Schedule, worker.PeekOutput, tensor.ReadbackAndClone, tensor.Dispose, worker.Dispose).
Log any caught exceptions with detailed context.
Consider providing fallback mechanisms or graceful degradation of features if Sentis fails to initialize or execute. For example, if wall segmentation cannot run, the application might revert to a non-ML mode or display an informative message to the user.



Memory Management: Neural networks and their tensor data can consume significant amounts of memory, both on the CPU and GPU.

Dispose Tensors and Workers: Sentis Tensor and Worker objects manage native memory resources that are not automatically garbage-collected by C#. It is crucial to explicitly call Dispose() on these objects when they are no longer needed to free this memory. Failure to do so can lead to memory leaks, eventually causing performance degradation or crashes. The Sentis changelog 21 mentions fixes like "CPU Tensors were not properly disposed," indicating that proper disposal is important.
C#// When done with a tensor:
if (myTensor!= null) { myTensor.Dispose(); myTensor = null; }
// When done with a worker (e.g., in OnDestroy()):
if (worker!= null) { worker.Dispose(); worker = null; }


RenderTexture Management: If TextureConverter.ToTexture is used frequently to create new RenderTexture objects, ensure these are also managed correctly (e.g., RenderTexture.Release() and Object.Destroy() when no longer needed) to prevent GPU memory exhaustion. 21 notes that the GPUPixel backend was updated to reuse RenderTextures, which helps reduce garbage collection and memory churn in that specific backend.
Profile Memory: Use the Unity Profiler (Memory module) to monitor memory allocations and identify potential leaks related to Sentis objects or other resources.


Adopting these practices will not only help in resolving current issues but also contribute to creating a more stable, performant, and professional machine learning application with Unity Sentis.7. Conclusion and Next StepsThe challenges encountered in the remalux-new-sentis project—manifesting as a black screen, console errors, and absent wall segmentation—are indicative of issues that can arise during the integration of complex systems like Unity Sentis. This report has provided a structured approach to diagnosing and resolving these problems, moving from foundational Unity checks to specifics of Sentis API usage, model management, input/output handling, and visualization.The key phases of troubleshooting involve:
Resolving the Black Screen: Addressing basic Unity configurations, potential Universal Render Pipeline (URP) conflicts, or AR-specific initialization failures.
Tackling Sentis Core Errors: Verifying Sentis package versions, ensuring strict compliance with current Sentis API (especially the transition from Sentis 1.x to 2.x regarding Tensor<float> and Worker instantiation), correctly loading the neural network model, preparing input tensors accurately, and configuring the inference worker. Interpreting console logs, with reference to Sentis changelogs 21, is crucial here.
Enabling Segmentation Visualization: Understanding the model's output tensor format and using appropriate techniques (like TextureConverter.ToTexture with TextureTransform, or custom shaders) to render the segmentation mask effectively.
A systematic, step-by-step debugging methodology, starting with simplified test cases and gradually adding complexity, is highly recommended. Particular attention should be paid to Sentis API versioning, as mismatches here are a frequent source of difficult-to-diagnose runtime errors.
